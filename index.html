    <h1>Steph Curry, DeMarcus Cousins Game 2 postgame interview | 2019 NBA Finals</h1><br>

    <div class="viddescription">
        <p>After the Golden State Warriors’ Game 2 win vs. the Toronto Raptors on Sunday night, DeMarcus Cousins talks about his comeback performance in which he played nearly 30 minutes; scoring 11 points, picking up 10 rebounds and dishing out six assists. His reaction to hearing that he’d be starting Game 2 gets the crowd laughing while Steph Curry adds that Cousins’ return to the floor was “special.” Curry then addresses leaving the game in the first half, saying that he “just didn’t feel right” but returned knowing how much game was left to be played. He also talks about the Warriors’ “strength in numbers” mantra and how it’s come into the spotlight during the NBA Finals, but says that in reality the team has been forming its DNA since training camp. Curry paraphrases coach Steve Kerr’s sentiments, saying that everyone on the roster has a chance to help the Warriors to victory throughout the season. </p><hr>
